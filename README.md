No database, no hassle! A simple way to render all your text files in a super visually appealing way!

#### Real talk
I basically made this project to practice and get a better understanding of file manipulation in PHP, thaz all! :sweat_smile:

#### Features
* Select a specific folder from your PHP script directory and instantly view all your text files only within that directory, thus allowing multiple blogs.

* The application sorts your text files in accordance to the time of creation and displays the latest one first.

* Each blog post show icons indicating what time of day (AM/PM) the corresponding file was created and also generates tags based on a predefined filename format (e.g filename - "food vietnamese_bakery cafe good_food.txt").
